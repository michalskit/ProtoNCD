# ProtoNCD: Prototypical Parts for Interpretable Novel Class Discovery
## Abstract
In this work, we introduce ProtoNCD, a novel approach to novel class discovery (NCD) that leverages prototypical parts for enhanced interpretability. ProtoNCD extends the ProtoPool methodology to the NCD setting, employing techniques such as knowledge distillation and specialized prototypical parts initialization. Through comprehensive experiments on the CUB-200-2011 dataset, we demonstrate the efficacy of ProtoNCD and its pivotal role in explaining how the reasoning of known classes influences predictions for those newly discovered.
